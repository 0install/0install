.SH SYNOPSIS

.B 0destkop
[ \fBURI\fP ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
0desktop can be used to create launchers for 0install applications in
desktop environments supporting the freedesktop.org menu specification (e.g.
GNOME and KDE).

.PP
If the URI of a 0install application is given, this application is added.
On success, a launcher is added to the user's menu which, when invoked, runs
the application using the command "0launch URI".

.PP
Without a URI, a dialog box is displayed listing the user's current applications and
allowing new ones to be added.

.SH FILES

.IP "~/.local/share/applications"
Default directory in which the .desktop file for the new launcher is created.
