.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
0desktop can be used to create launchers for Zero Install applications in
desktop environments supporting the freedesktop.org menu specification (e.g.
GNOME and KDE).

.PP
If the URI of a Zero Install application is given, this application is added.
Without a URI, a dialog box is displayed prompting the user to specify what to add.
On success, a launcher is added to the user's menu which, when invoked, runs
the application using the command "0launch URI".

.SH FILES

.IP "~/.local/share/applications"
Default directory in which the .desktop file for the new launcher is created.
