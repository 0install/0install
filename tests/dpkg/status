Description: Scatter-gather network file transfer
 BitTorrent is a tool for distributing files. It's extremely
 easy to use - downloads are started by clicking on hyperlinks.
 Whenever more than one person is downloading at once
 they send pieces of the file(s) to each other, thus relieving
 the central server's bandwidth burden. Even with many
 simultaneous downloads, the upload burden on the central server
 remains quite small, since each new downloader introduces new
 upload capacity.

 This package contains the python modules.

Description: X11 Composite extension library (development headers)
 libXcomposite provides an X Window System client interface to the Composite
 extension to the X protocol.

 The Composite extension allows clients called compositing managers to control
 the final drawing of the screen.  Rendering is done into an off-screen buffer.
 .
 This package contains the development headers for the library found in
 libxcomposite1.  Non-developers likely have little use for this package.
