.SH NAME
0alias \- create quick scripts to run 0launch

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B 0alias
\fBALIAS\fP \fBINTERFACE\fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Having to keep typing the full URI for a program each time you want to run it
with 0launch is annoying. 0alias will create a little script in your PATH to
do it for you.

.SH EXAMPLES

.PP
A program is normally invoked using 0launch:

.B 0launch http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit

.PP
To avoid having to keep entering the URI, create an alias:

.B 0alias rox-edit http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit

.PP
To run Edit now:

.B rox-edit

.PP
To select a different version, or check for updates:

.B rox-edit --versions


.SH COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS

.TP
\fB-V\fP, \fB--version\fP
