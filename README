Injector-GUI -- a graphical interface for the zero install injector

Copyright Thomas Leonard, 2005

This is an experimental prototype -- use at your own risk!

The injector GUI displays a window showing which versions of various components
will be used when running a program, and allows you to alter various policy
settings to affect the selection process. You can use this to mark particular
versions of libraries as preferred, bugggy, etc.
