The Zero Install Injector

Copyright Thomas Leonard, 2005

This is an experimental prototype -- use at your own risk!


INTRODUCTION

A program is made up of many different components, typically written by
different groups of people. Each component is available in multiple versions.
The injector is used when starting a program. Its job is to decide which
implementation of each required component to use.

An interface describes what a component does. The injector starts with the
interface for the program you want to run (like 'The Gimp') and chooses an
implementation (like 'The Gimp 2.2.0'). However, this implementation will in
turn depend on other interfaces, such as 'GTK' (which draws the menus and
buttons). Thus, the injector must choose implementations of each dependancy
(each of which may require further interfaces, and so on).

See http://0install.net/injector.html for details.


INSTALLATION

The injector uses the normal Python distutils method of installation. To
install, become root and run setup.py like this:

  $ su
  [ enter root password ]
  # python setup.py install
  # exit
  $


USE

To run a program by its URI:

$ 0launch http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit

To run create short-cut:

$ 0alias rox-edit http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit
