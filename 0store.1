.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
0store provides access to the low-level implementation cache. Normally, the
cache updated automatically using 0launch(1).

.SH LIST

.PP
See the list of implementation caches currently configured:

.B 0store list

.SH MANIFEST
.PP
To generate the manifest for a directory structure:

.B 0store manifest DIRECTORY

.PP
The manifest lists every file and directory in the tree, along with the SHA1
digest of each file, thus uniquely identifying that particular set of files.
After the manifest, the last line gives the SHA1 digest of the manifest itself.
This value is needed when creating interface files. See the packager's guide on
the Zero Install web site for details.
