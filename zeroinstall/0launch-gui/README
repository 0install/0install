Injector-GUI -- a graphical interface for the zero install injector

Copyright Thomas Leonard, 2005-2006

The injector GUI displays a window showing which versions of various components
will be used when running a program, and allows you to alter various policy
settings to affect the selection process. You can use this to mark particular
versions of libraries as preferred, bugggy, etc.

It is not normally run directy. Instead, the 0launch command runs it
automatically when it needs to download something or to interact with the user.
