"""
Information about the current system's architecture.

This module provides information about the current system. It is used to determine
whether an implementation is suitable for this machine, and to compare different implementations.

For example, it will indicate that:

 - An i486 machine cannot run an i686 binary.
 - An i686 machine can run an i486 binary, but would prefer an i586 one.
 - A Windows binary cannot run on a Linux machine.

Each dictionary maps from a supported architecture type to a preference level. Lower numbers are
better, Unsupported architectures are not listed at all.
