"""
The Python implementation of the Zero Install injector is divided into three packages:

 - zeroinstall (this package) just defines a couple of exceptions and the version number.
 - L{zeroinstall.injector} contains most of the interesting stuff.
 - L{zeroinstall.zerostore} contains low-level code for handling the
   implementation cache.
