  (** [do_solve model req] finds an implementation matching the given requirements, plus any other implementations needed
   * to satisfy its dependencies.
   * @param dummy_impl adds a lowest-ranked (but valid) implementation to
   *   every interface, so we can always select something. Useful for diagnostics.
   *   You should ensure that [Model.get_command] always returns a dummy command for dummy_impl too.
   *   Note: always try without a [dummy_impl] first, or it may miss a valid solution.
   * @return None if the solve fails (only happens if [closest_match] is false). *)
