(** Some useful abstract module types. *)

open Support.Common

type iface_uri = string
(** A URI used to identify an interface.
    Uses only plain URI characters, unicode chars, spaces, etc are %-escaped. *)

type feed_url = string

module type MAP = sig
  include Map.S

  (** Safe version of [find] that returns an option. *)
  val find : key -> 'a t -> 'a option

module type CORE_MODEL = sig
  module Role : sig
    (** A role that needs to be filled by a single implementation.
     * If two dependencies require the same role then they will both
     * get the same implementation. *)
    type t
    val to_string : t -> string
    val compare : t -> t -> int
  end

  (** An [impl] is something that can fill a [Role.t] *)
  type impl

  (** A [command] is an entry-point provided by an implementation.
   * Using a command may require extra dependencies (for example, a "test" command
   * might depend on a test runner). *)
  type command

  (** An identifier for a command within a role. *)
  type command_name = private string

  (** A dependency indicates that an impl or command requires another role to be filled. *)
  type dependency

    dep_role : Role.t;

    (* If the dependency is [`Essential] then its role must be filled.
     * Otherwise, we just prefer to fill it if possible.
     * A [`Restricts] dependency does not cause the solver to try to fill a role, it just
     * adds restrictions if it is used for some other reason. *)

  (** Get an implementation's dependencies.
   *
   * The dependencies should be ordered with the most important first.
   * The solver will prefer to select the best possible version of an earlier
   * dependency, even if that means selecting a worse version of a later one
   * ([restricts_only] dependencies are ignored for this).
   *
   * An implementation or command can also bind to itself.
   * e.g. "test" command that requires its own "run" command.
   * We also return all such required commands. *)

module type SOLVER_RESULT = sig

   * Unlike the plain [SELECTIONS] type, this type can relate the selections back
   * to the solver inputs, which is useful to provide diagnostics and the GUI. *)

  (** Get the candidates which were rejected for a role (and not passed to the solver),
   * as well as any general notes and warnings not tied to a particular impl. *)
  val rejects : Role.t -> (impl * rejection) list * string list

  (** Used to sort the results. *)
  val compare_version : impl -> impl -> int

  (* A dummy implementation, used to get diagnostic information if the solve fails.
   * It satisfies all requirements, even conflicting ones. *)

  val save_path : key -> config -> filepath
  (** [save_path key config] creates a directory for [key] in the first directory in
      the search path (if it doesn't yet exist) and returns the path of the
      [key] within it (which may not yet exist). *)
