  <summary>decentralised installation system</summary>
  <description>
Zero Install is a cross-platform, decentralised installation system. Instead of
having a central repository in which all software is placed under a naming
scheme managed by some central authority, programs and libraries in Zero Install
are identified by URIs. Anyone who can create a web-page can publish software.
Anyone can install software (not just root).

Conceptually, you can imagine that the software is 'installed' only on a remote
machine and that you are simply running it (on your own machine) using a network
filesystem. Caching makes this fast and allows off-line use. The cache is
indexed using a cryptographic hash, allowing it to be shared between mutually
untrusting users automatically.

Zero Install resolves dependencies (such as libraries) on a per-program basis,
which eliminates conflicts. You will never be told that installing one program
requires first uninstalling another.</description>
