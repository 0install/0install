.SH NAME
0launch \- download and run programs by URL

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B 0launch

.B 0launch
--list [\fBSEARCH-TERM\fP]

.B 0launch
--import [\fBINTERFACE-FILES\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
A program is made up of many different components, typically written by
different groups of people. Each component is available in multiple versions.
The injector is used when starting a program. Its job is to decide which
implementation of each required component to use.

.PP
An interface describes what a component does. The injector starts with the
interface for the program you want to run (like 'The Gimp') and chooses an
implementation (like 'The Gimp 2.2.0'). However, this implementation will in
turn depend on other interfaces, such as 'GTK' (which draws the menus and
buttons). Thus, the injector must choose implementations of each dependancy
(each of which may require further interfaces, and so on).

.SH EXAMPLES

.PP
When a program is available using 0launch, it will have an associated URL. To
run the program, simply invoke 0launch with this as an argument:

.B 0launch http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit

.PP
The first time you do this, details about the program are downloaded and
cached, and you will be prompted to confirm the versions to use. In future,
the program will run directly from the cache without confirmation.

.PP
To check for new versions:

.B 0launch --refresh http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit

.PP
To search the list of cached URLs:

.B 0launch --list Edit

.SH COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS

.TP
\fB-c\fP, \fB--console\fP
Never use the GUI. Normally, 0launch switches to graphical mode if it needs to
download anything from the network (unless DISPLAY is not set).

.TP
\fB-d\fP, \fB--download-only\fP
Download any needed files, but stop before actually running the program.

.TP
\fB-D\fP, \fB--dry-run\fP
Just print what actions would be taken.

.TP
\fB-g\fP, \fB--gui\fP
Show the graphical policy editor. This allows you to select which version of
a program or library to use.

.TP
\fB-h\fP, \fB--help\fP
Show the built-in help text.

.TP
\fB-i\fP, \fB--import\fP
Import from files, not from the network. This is useful when testing an
interface file, to avoid uploading it to a remote server in order to download
it again. It might also be useful when installing from a CD or similar.

.TP
\fB-l\fP, \fB--list\fP
List all known interface (program) URIs. If a search term is given, only
URIs containing that string are shown (case insensitive).

.TP
\fB-r\fP, \fB--refresh\fP
Fetch a fresh copy of all used interfaces. This will normally switch to GUI
mode, unless --console is also given.

.TP
\fB-v\fP, \fB--verbose\fP
More verbose output. Use twice for even more verbose output.

.TP
\fB-V\fP, \fB--version\fP
Display version information.
