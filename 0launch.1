.TH 0LAUNCH 1 "2005" "Thomas Leonard" ""
.SH NAME
0launch \- download and run programs by URL

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B 0launch
[\fBOPTION\fP]... \fBINTERFACE\fP [\fBARG\fP]...

.B 0launch
--list [\fBSEARCH-TERM\fP]

.B 0launch
--import [\fBINTERFACE-FILES\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
0launch runs a program, identified by an `INTERFACE' URL. If the program is not
already on your computer, it downloads information about which versions are
available, and lets you choose one to download. It will also (automatically)
do the same for libraries the program needs.

.PP
0launch will also check for updates if it has been a long time since the last
check (configurable).
0launch therefore allows users to download and upgrade software without
needing root access.

.SH EXAMPLES

.PP
When a program is available using 0launch, it will have an associated URL. To
run the program, simply invoke 0launch with this as an argument:

.B 0launch http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit

.PP
The first time you do this, details about the program are downloaded and
cached, and you will be prompted to confirm the versions to use. In future,
the program will run directly from the cache without confirmation.

.PP
To check for new versions:

.B 0launch --refresh http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit

.PP
To search the list of cached URLs:

.B 0launch --list Edit

.PP
To avoid having to keep typing the full URI, use the 0alias(1) command
to create shortcuts to run your programs.

.SH COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS

.TP
\fB-a\fP, \fB--add-feed\fP
Register an additional source of implementations. When you get a CVS
version of a project, it may contain an interface XML file. To add this version
to the list of available versions, use --add-feed on this file. The file is
not copied, so you don't need to re-add the file each time it is updated.

Note that if you just want to run the program, you can invoke 0launch on the
interface file directly (without using --add-feed). This will force the
injector to use that version, but won't affect what happens when you run it
using the URI as normal. Use --add-feed when you want to use the CVS version
even when using the URI, or if the program is a library (and thus referenced
by URI by other programs).

Note also that the stability of CVS versions may be set to 'developer', in
which case you must set this as the preferred stability for the interface
(using the GUI).

.TP
\fB-c\fP, \fB--console\fP
Never use the GUI. Normally, 0launch switches to graphical mode if it needs to
download anything from the network (unless DISPLAY is not set).

.TP
\fB-d\fP, \fB--download-only\fP
Download any needed files, but stop before actually running the program.

.TP
\fB-D\fP, \fB--dry-run\fP
Just print what actions would be taken.

.TP
\fB-g\fP, \fB--gui\fP
Show the graphical policy editor. This allows you to select which version of
a program or library to use.

.TP
\fB-h\fP, \fB--help\fP
Show the built-in help text.

.TP
\fB-i\fP, \fB--import\fP
Import from files, not from the network. This is useful when testing an
interface file, to avoid uploading it to a remote server in order to download
it again. It might also be useful when installing from a CD or similar.
The file must have a trusted GPG digital signature, as when fetching from
the network. For unsigned interfaces, see --add-feed.

.TP
\fB-l\fP, \fB--list\fP
List all known interface (program) URIs. If a search term is given, only
URIs containing that string are shown (case insensitive).

.TP
\fB-m\fP, \fB--main=MAIN\fP
Run the specified executable instead of the default. If MAIN starts with '/'
then the path is relative to the implementation's top-level directory,
whereas otherwise it is relative to the directory containing the default
MAIN program. For example, if the default MAIN is \fBbin/svn\fP then
using \fB--main=svnadmin\fP will run \fB.../bin/svnadmin\fP instead.

.TP
\fB-r\fP, \fB--refresh\fP
Fetch a fresh copy of all used interfaces. This will normally switch to GUI
mode, unless --console is also given. Note that using --refresh and --gui
together will check for updates to the GUI itself.

.TP
\fB-v\fP, \fB--verbose\fP
More verbose output. Use twice for even more verbose output.

.TP
\fB-V\fP, \fB--version\fP
Display version information.
